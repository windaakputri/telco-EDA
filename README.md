# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Telco Customer Churn

## Introduction
It is a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. ‘Understand the data’ can refer to a number of things:
- Identifying outliers or missing values
- Understanding the relationship between variables
- Ultimately, maximizing your insights of a dataset and minimizing potential error later in the process

EDA is all about making sense of data in hand,before getting them dirty with it.

## Dataset
The data is sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes.

The data set includes information about:
- Customers who left within the last month (the column is called 'Churn')
- Services that each customer has signed up for (phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies)
- Customer account information (how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges)
- Demographic info about customers (gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents)
